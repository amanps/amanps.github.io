My name is Amanpreet Singh. People call me Aman.

I'm a design minded developer who enjoys building solid mobile applications that deliver beautiful experiences. I wear green to an Android vs iOS faceoff, support Manchester United FC and always have a song stuck in my head. Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/multivitaman) and ask me which one.
