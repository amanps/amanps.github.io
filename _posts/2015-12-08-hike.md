In the summer of 2015, I joined [Hike Messenger](https://hike.in/) as an Android Software Engineering Intern. Hike is India’s leading messaging application with over 70 million users. Hike was built with the powerful idea of "Bringing India Online", with several features and optimizations aimed directly at the Indian mobile market: low-end mobile devices, slow internet speeds and overall unfamiliarity with the internet.

Hike is much more than a messaging application. It hosts several little “microapps” like News, Games and Live Cricket Scores. The idea behind these lightweight microapps was to provide useful services to users right from within the Hike app, so they don’t have to download individual apps, most of which are in excess of 10-15 mb each. Low end devices don’t do well with a ton of apps installed and have very little memory to begin with. Understandably, microapps were a big hit among Hike users and got a ton of engagement.

During my internship I got the chance to work on many different areas of the Hike Android app. I worked on improving the Javascriptbridge Platform SDK that supported these microapps, on improving location services, adding rich content to notifications, tiny UI enhancements like a WebView error page and code refactoring to improve code architecture and app open time.

In this post, I'd like to highlight two of my favorite projects at Hike.

### Hike Discover

My favorite project at Hike was building Hike Discover, a showcase that put these microapps front and center.

We built this feature with an app store (of sorts) in mind. Showcases were personalized for each user, users could revisit their favorite apps, discover and download new ones and the product team could push onboarding flows for newly released apps to increase discovery.
The whole process of ideation, design, development and release of this feature was super fun and challenging for me as it was the first feature I would own independently. At the end of the full rollout, we could see a significant increase in microapp DAU and fresh installs. I was elated.

### Microapp Interaction
The goal for this project was to build functionality to display contextually relevant interaction panels which drive a user's conversation with a bot on Hike. A bot could decide a relevant panel to be displayed along with its message, just like the one Natasha has chosen to display along with her introductory message. This not only provided the user some relevant replies to pick from, it reduced the amount of uncertainty that a typed out user response carries. Of course, the user could still choose to type out a response instead.

Using wit.ai to capture entities and intents from these user responses, we built a proof-of-concept mobile phone payments bot called 'Recharge Shop' which used these interaction panels to gather information about the transaction. Complete with payment gateway integration, this bot could actually pay phone bills. (No wonder I used my own phone number for "testing" a couple of times!).

As you can probably tell, this was by no means a finished product and didn't make it to production. Nonetheless, it was a POC that built a strong case for further development of these bots and microapp keyboards. Moreover, playing around with wit.ai and building a bot to understand conversation has got me really intrigued by how these NLP APIs work under the hood.

### Reflection
This was my first experience working in the industry and I couldn't have asked for a better one. There are some really talented folks working towards this powerful idea of "Bringing India Online" and I'm really glad I was a part of that family. I've grown so much as a software developer, met some wonderful people and experienced New Delhi like a local. But quite honestly, what I'm going to miss most is waking up and heading to arguably the best office space in all of India. I mean, [take a look](https://careers.hike.in/headquaters.html).
