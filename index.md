I'm Amanpreet Singh. People call me Aman.

Iâ€™m a software developer who enjoys building products that deliver delightful experiences. I published my first project as an Android app in 2015 and have since worked on several products both independently and professionally. Aside from programming, I enjoy thinking about user experience and interface design, something I like to incorporate in anything I build.

I'm currently a graduate student at The Ohio State University, pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a focus in Machine Learning.

Feel free to check out my work [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/work). I sometimes write about code (mostly as a reference for my future self) in my [blog]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/blog).
