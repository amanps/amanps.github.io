I'm Amanpreet Singh. People call me Aman.

I'm a software developer who enjoys building mobile applications that deliver delightful experiences. I published my first Android app in 2015 and have since worked on several apps both independently and professionally. Aside from programming, I enjoy thinking about product design and user experience, something I like to incorporate in anything I build.

I'm currently a graduate student at the Ohio State University, pursuing a Master's in Computer Science where I'm exploring my interests in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

Feel free to check out my work [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/work). I sometimes write about code (mostly as a reference for my future self) in my [blog]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/blog).
