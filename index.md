I’m Aman, a software engineer based in Seattle. I find great joy in building products that solve interesting problems and delight people.

I’m currently at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), working on [Radar](https://stripe.com/radar) — a product at the intersection of machine learning, product design and software architecture — that protects businesses from sketchy fraudsters.
